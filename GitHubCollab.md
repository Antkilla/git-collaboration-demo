# GitHub Project Collaboration Steps

1. For project owners only: Create new repo in GitHub Desktop Client with project name.
2. For project owners only: Open repo in VS Code and run the command: <br>
`npx create-react-app ./` <br>
to initialize the necessarry React application files.
3. For project owners only: Remove unneccesary files and unnecessary code from remaining files. 
* In `public` folder, leave only `index.html`
* In `src` folder, leave only `App.css`, `App.js`, and `index.js`
* Check Slack for examples of how remaining files should appear. Clear out `App.css` entirely.
4. For project owners only: Commit and push repo in current state to GitHub
