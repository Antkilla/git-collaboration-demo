# GitHub Project Collaboration Steps

## For Project Owners:
1. Create new repo in GitHub Desktop Client with project name.
2. Open repo in VS Code and run the command: <br>
`npx create-react-app ./` <br>
to initialize the necessarry React application files.
3. Remove unneccesary files and unnecessary code from remaining files. 
* In `public` folder, leave only `index.html`
* In `src` folder, leave only `App.css`, `App.js`, and `index.js`
* Check Slack for examples of how remaining files should appear. Clear out `App.css` entirely.
4. Commit and push repo in current state to GitHub.
5. Change repo's visibility to 'Public' and add team members as collaborators to project on GitHub.com

## For Non-Project Owners
6. Accept the repo collab invite from the owner.
7. Fork the repo on GitHub.com
8. Using GitHub Desktop, clone the repo from your GitHub account onto your local machine.
9. Choose the option to contribute to the parent repo, NOT to clone for own purposes.
10. Click 'Fetch Origin' to get the most up to date version of the remote repo (DO THIS EVERY TIME YOU START WORKING ON THE PROJECT).
